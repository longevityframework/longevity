Implementations for the methods in `UserService` are provided in
`UserServiceImpl.scala`. To do its job, the `UserServiceImpl` needs a
user repository, which is retrieved from the `LongevityContext` in
`SimblContextImpl.scala` like so:

```scala
val longevityContext = LongevityContext(SimblSubdomain)
val repoPool = longevityContext.repoPool
val userRepo = repoPool[User]
```

Because most of the repository methods need an execution context to
run in, `SimblContextImpl` also provides an execution context that it
pulls out of the Akka `ActorSystem`. Akka HTTP already needs an
`ExecutionContext` to run. In other scenarios, you can always find an
execution context in
`scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext.Implicits.global`.

Here's the scaffolding for `UserServiceImpl`, which shows how the
class acquires its two dependencies:

```scala
package simbl.service

import longevity.persistence.Repo
import scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext

/** default implementation of service to back the [[UserRoute user routes]] */
class UserServiceImpl(
  private val userRepo: Repo[User])(
  implicit context: ExecutionContext)
extends UserService {

  // ...

}
```

There are a number of service methods in `UserServiceImpl`. In this
tutorial, we will focus on three: `createUser`, `retrieveUser`, and
`updateUser`.

{% assign prevTitle = "the user service" %}
{% assign prevLink = "service.html" %}
{% assign upTitle = "getting started guide" %}
{% assign upLink = "." %}
{% assign nextTitle="UserServiceImpl.createUser" %}
{% assign nextLink="create-user.html" %}
{% include navigate.html %}
