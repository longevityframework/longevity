A Persistence Framework for Scala and NoSQL.

Build your data model using standard Scala idioms such as case
classes, companion objects, options, and immutable collections. Tell
us about the types in your model, and we provide the persistence.

Persistence concerns and operations are abstracted behind an elegant
persistence API. We provide you with fully featured repositories for
[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.org/) and
[Cassandra](http://cassandra.apache.org/). We provide a suite of
integration tests to exercise your repositories against a real
database, as well as in-memory repositories for other tests.

For more information, please visit the [longevity
website](http://longevityframework.github.io/longevity/).

[Emblem](https://github.com/longevityframework/emblem) source code is
also currently housed under this repository.
