The persistent object is translated directly into a BSON document as
described in the earlier section [Persistent to JSON](json.html). Some
other persistence-related fields are added to the JSON. All these
fields are prefixed with an underscore (`_`). For this reason, we
**highly recommend against** writing [persistent
objects](../persistent) with members whose names start with an
underscore.

As of now, we add two underscore-prefixed columns to the BSON. The
first is `_id`, as described in the [next
section](mongo-keys.html). The second is `_rowVersion`, which is used
by [optimistic locking](../context/opt-lock.html), and is only
included when optimistic locking is turned on. You can expect to see
more such fields in the future, such as `_createdDate`, `_createdBy`,
`_modifiedDate`, `_modifiedBy`, and `_schemaVersion`.

MongoDB collection names are generated by [uncapitalizing the
camel-cased](http://longevityframework.github.io/longevity/scaladocs/emblem-latest/index.html#emblem.stringUtil$@uncapitalize(s:String):String)
name of the persistent class.
