Sometimes, of course, we want to use [subtype
polymorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(computer_science)#Subtyping)
in our domain models. Longevity supports polymorphism in both your
[persistent objects](../subdomain/persistents.html) and your
[persistent components](../subdomain/components.html). Polymorphism
for components allows us to create and use controlled vocabularies in
a standard Scala idiom. This chapter is broken up into the following
pages:

- [Polymorphic Components](components.html)
- [Polymorphic Persistents](persistents.html)
- [Controlled Vocabularies](cv.html)
