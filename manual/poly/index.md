Sometimes, of course, we want to use [subtype
polymorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(computer_science)#Subtyping)
in our domain models. Longevity supports polymorphism in both your
[persistents](persistent) and your [embeddable
objects](embeddable). Polymorphism for embeddable objects
allows us to create and use controlled vocabularies in a standard
Scala idiom. This chapter is broken up into the following pages:

- [Polymorphic Embeddables](embeddables.html)
- [Polymorphic Persistents](persistents.html)
- [Controlled Vocabularies](cv.html)
