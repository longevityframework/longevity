<h2>Focus your development on your domain model, not your database model</h2>

Longevity translates your domain into a natural, easy to understand
database model. Your persistent objects are stored as JSON, and we add
any other database schema needed to keep performance fast.

You no longer need to:

  - design a database schema
  - build and maintain a translation layer between your domain model and
    database model
  - build and maintain integration tests for your translation layer
  - make compromises in your domain model to satisfy your database model
    or translation layer

With longevity, persistence concerns and operations are abstracted
behind an elegant persistence API. We provide you with fully featured
repositories for [Cassandra](http://cassandra.apache.org/),
[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.org/), and
[SQLite](https://sqlite.org/).
