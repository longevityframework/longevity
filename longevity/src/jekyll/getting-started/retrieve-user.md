Here's the code for `UserServiceImpl.retrieveUser`:

```scala
  def retrieveUser(username: String): Future[Option[UserInfo]] = {
    for {
      retrieved <- userRepo.retrieve(Username(username))
    } yield {
      def stateToInfo(state: PState[User]) = UserInfo(state.get)
      retrieved.map(stateToInfo)
    }
  }
```

This method does its work by calling `userRepo.retrieve`. To call this
method, we have to convert from the `username` string to a `Username`,
as `userRepo.retrieve` takes a `KeyVal` as argument.

Once again, the `User` is wrapped in a `PState`, so we can manipulate
its persistent state if we wish. This in turn is wrapped in an
`Option`, as there may or may not be a user with that username. This
in turn is wrapped in a `Future`, as we want to treat the database
call in an asynchronous fashion. This feels like a lot of layers of
wrapping, but they are not too painful to work with if you use for
comprehensions.

Once the user is retrieved, we still need to map the
`Option[PState[User]]` to an `Option[UserInfo]`. This is done in two
lines in the `yield` clause of the for comprehension. When
`retrieveUser` returns a future `None`, Akka HTTP will generate a `404
Not Found`
