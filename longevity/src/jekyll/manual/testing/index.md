Longevity provides many tools for you to use in testing. For starters,
there are in-memory versions of all your repositories. We also provide
tools for you to do database integration tests - that is, tests that
exercise the repository against a real database. The `RepoCrudSpec`
tests basic CRUD operations for all your aggregates out of the
box. And you can subclass `QuerySpec` to easily exercise any queries
you rely on.

<code>RepoCrudSpec</code> and <code>QuerySpec</code> are both <a href

very high on our priority list. Please let us know if you would like
to see these, and we will adjust the priority.
