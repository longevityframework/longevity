The persistent object is translated directly into a BSON document as
described in the earlier section [Persistent to JSON](json.html). Some
other persistence-related fields are added to the BSON. All these
fields are prefixed with an underscore (`_`). For this reason, we
**highly recommend against** writing [persistent
objects](../persistent) with members whose names start with an
underscore.

We add some underscore-prefixed properties to the BSON. The first is
`_id`, as described in the [next section](mongo-keys.html). The second
is `_rowVersion`, which is used by [optimistic
locking](../context/opt-lock.html), and is only included when
optimistic locking is turned on. We also include timestamp properties
`_createdTimestamp` and `_updatedTimestamp` for diagnostic purposes,
when [write timestamps](../context/write-timestamps.html) is turned on.
More such fields may be added in the future.

MongoDB collection names are generated by uncapitalizing the camel-cased name of the persistent
class.
